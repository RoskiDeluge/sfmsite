          <h2>How does he do it?</h2>
            <p>"The male fish, which measures less than 5 inches (13 centimeters) long, first uses his body to create peaks and valleys in the sandy bottom around a central circle of smooth sand. He accomplishes this feat by swimming in toward the center of the circle in a straight line and then back around the center in a circular motion" (Bates, "What's This Mysterious Circle on the Sea Floor?").</p>

          <h2>Why does he do it?</h2>
            <p>"...In the pufferfish species investigated in this study, the nest exhibited 3 unusual characteristics that have never been reported in fish. First, radially aligned peaks and valleys were created outside the nest site; second, the peaks were decorated with shell fragments; and third, fine sand particles were gathered in the nest site to create an irregular pattern. All 3 characteristics were completed and maintained before mating, when females visited the nest site, and they collapsed thereafter. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume that females visiting male nest sites evaluate nest characteristics and that these characteristics play an important role in female mate choice. However, the definite factors affecting this choice remain unknown, i.e. size of the circular structure; symmetric properties, peak height, number of radially aligned peaks and valleys; size, colour, number and arrangement of the ornaments; and the design, amount and quality of the fine sand particles in the irregular central pattern" (Kawase et al.).</p>
